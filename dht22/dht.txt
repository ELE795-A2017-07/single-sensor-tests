Open line is high (pull up)

Start signal is sent by master: pull line low for at least 1ms
wait 20 to 40 us

sensor pulls line low for 80us
sensor releases line (high) for 80us

0 bit is:
50us low, 26-28us high (next bit follows immediately)
1 bit is:
50us low, 70us high (next bit follows immediately)

data is:
8bit + 8bit + 8bit + 8bit + 8bit = 40 bits
RHd.RHf, Td.Tf, checksum
checksum = (RHd + RHf + Td + Tf) & 0xff

Note: timing seems to all be minimum (50us may be 60us)
